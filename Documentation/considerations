# Things to consider/to-do

Splash page
- Redirect to Dashboard page if logged in
- Add better styling when sprites/graphics are made

Login/register page
- "Home" button should not redirect if not logged in? -> create a new page that says "You need to be logged in to access..." or smth and have buttons for login or register

Dashboard page
- Register and login buttons should/should not be accessible or minimized to somewhere else on the page instead of main header

New Game page
- Don't let a logged in player continue into the new game page to add tasks/points if they are already in a game (prompt them that they're already in a game). Just tell them to go to the Continue Game page or something.
