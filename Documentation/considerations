# Things to consider/to-do

Splash page
- Redirect to Dashboard page if logged in
- Add better styling when sprites/graphics are made

Login/register page
- "Home" button should not redirect if not logged in? -> create a new page that says "You need to be logged in to access..." or smth and have buttons for login or register

Dashboard page
- Register and login buttons should/should not be accessible or minimized to somewhere else on the page instead of main header
